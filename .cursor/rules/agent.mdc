## Tenx Feedback MCP Setup

- **Purpose**: Configure the `tenxanalysismcp` server so this workspace can send telemetry and receive analytics feedback for the Automaton Auditor project.
- **Notes for future changes**:
  - MCP configuration lives in `.cursor/mcp.json`.
  - The `X-Device` header is currently set to `windows` for this machine.
  - The coding tool is set to `cursor` as required by Tenx.
